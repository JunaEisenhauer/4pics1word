# 4 pics 1 word
In the course web programming I have to develop a little website with the topic `quiz`. We were only allowed to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript with jQuery.
I decided to make a clone of 4 pictures 1 word where you have to guess the right word given four pictures and a set of letters to form the word.

## Getting Started
1. Clone git repository to your local machine.
2. Open WebStorm/Visual Studio Code (or IDE of your choice) in the root directory of this project.
3. Start a live webserver and run the website.

## What I have learned
- Deepening the HTML skills and learning the new HTML5 tags and features
- Deepening the CSS skills
- Using JavaScript for a dynamic website
- Working with jQuery to make life easier
- Implementing animations with jQuery
- Working with Ajax to load data asynchronously
